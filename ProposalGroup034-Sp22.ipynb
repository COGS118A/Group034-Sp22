    "# Abstract \n",
    "Our goal is to predict the end-match result of the e-sport League of Legend based on in game data (10 minutes data). To be specific, we would like to predict the winner (represented by team blue and team red), based on in-game statistics such as first-blood, first dragon and more. The data was extracted from the API that Riot provided. They are measured by matches finished by high-level players. We will use the winner data sample as the label and implement a binary classification Machine Learning model on it. The performance will be measured by the percentage of successful prediction. There is a high potential that the victory will be associated with one or even more of these characteristics."

    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Nowadays, League of Legends could be said as one of the most popular and successful Multiplayer Online Battle Arena(MOBA) games in the world. Each game has two teams of five people across three lanes. The most important and intriguing part to the players is the ranking competition. It’s a game that utilizes both the players' skills and team building abilities[^1]. In addition to those, there are other variables such as the combination of heroes, the number of dragons killed, and the number of minions killed that determine the success of the game.[2]  As the popularity grow, the world league of legend competition becomes more specialized like a sports game, thus the professional team want to know the probability of winning the game and the determinants to achieve it for team training.\n",
    "Therefore, we wonder if we are able to use these pre-gram and in-game features including player’s personal skills , team bonding and decision making in each match to make a prediction of the champion of the team. The analyses on these features to the game are useful for training purposes to improve the preparation of players in addition to the outcome prediction of each match.[3]  Machine learning is a useful application as a game prediction in sports and esports. For this particular problem, we want to predict win or lose through a classification problem that separates into two classes.\n",

    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "We are trying to implement a model that takes in-match data as inputs and outputs the predicted end-result of the match. In general, binary-classification related Machine Learning models would be a good solution for this problem. Since the results of the game are binary (win or lose). The attributes in our model include continuous and discrete values and are directly retracted from the official API from Riot. These attributes are strongly related to the result of the match. \n",
    "\n",
    "Predicting the result of a game would be valuable in a variety of cases. Under any circumstances that any individual would like to predict the outcome of a game, the problem will be replicable. "

    "# Proposed Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "We will recommend a set of heroes, runes, outfits and game strategies that will help users maximize their win rate over time and thus win the game. To achieve this goal, we will use a series of data manipulation methods including NumPy, Scikit-learn's classification.First, we will test the correlation between each features and the others. Then, we will sort out and rank the features that are most influencing to the blueWins(It’s the result of the game). Find out the 10 most influencing features. Next, we start to select the models from decision tree, Naive Bayes, random forest, logistic regression, and k-nearest neighbors.Then we list out and compare the accuracy of the test data among these models. Until we find the best classifier model, we start fine tuning the classifier using hyperparameter tuning. For the number of features needed, we then compare the accuracy of test data between the model with all features included and only 10 most influencing features included. To test the solution, we will draw a decision boundary and figure out the training error, testing error, and generalization error. \n",
    "\n",
    "The benchmark model we will use is Linear Regression and k-Nearest Neighbors. These are the two most commonly used models for doing classification. Therefore, we will use the basic linear regression amd K-nearest neighbor to use as a benchmark for setting a basic requirement for our performance of model.\n"
